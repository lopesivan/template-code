// Where  is  the  definition  of  the  function?  Programmers  who
// are  getting to  know  metafunctions  tend to ask such a
// question. In fact, lines 1â€“17 of the code snippet already define
// a function Fun_, and  line 19  uses Fun_<int>::type  to  return
// unsigned  int,  so  line  19  is  equivalent  to defining  an
// unsigned integer variable h and initialized with 3.
